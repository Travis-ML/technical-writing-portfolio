Collection of technical articles and guides by Travis Lelle.

**WhoAmI**: I'm a Security Engineer, ML/AI Researcher and Cloud Architect (Primarily AWS, but I have experince in all 3 of the big cloud providers - AWS/Azure/GCP). I'm also an early adopter of Cryptocurrency, a motorcyclist, and I'm addicted to studying material that has a technical difficulty outside of my comfort zone.
