Collection of technical articles and guides by Travis Lelle.

WhoAmI: I'm a security engineer with a specialization in Data science, Data analytics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Cloud (Primarily AWS, but I have experince in all 3 of the big cloud providers - AWS/Azure/GCP). I'm also an early adopter of Cryptocurrency, a motorcyclist, and I'm addicted to studying material that has a technical difficulty outside of my comfort zone.
